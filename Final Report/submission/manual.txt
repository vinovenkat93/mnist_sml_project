External libraries required
===========================
Language (version): Python 2.7+
Packages used: scikit-learn, numpy, scipy, matplotlib

Running the code
================
After setting up the environment:
- Run "main.py" to generate the results 
- This should produce almost all of the plots
- All the results (including execution time data which were not included 
in the report) will be stored in corresponding .csv files with apprpriate names
- Some plots like the Precision, Recall curves and a few plots for KNN were 
plotted manually using the stored data
- All the paths are relative, hence requiring no manual folder creation

Using the dataset
=================
- While the dataset has been provided in the 'dataset' folder, the code is setup
to download the dataset automatically
- All the pre-processing is done in the code and requires no additional steps

Suggestions
===========
- None of the experiments should take an exceptional amount of time to run
- However, we suggest not running all the experiments at the same time. Instead, 
please comment out suitable experiments in the main.py as they all run independantly
- The experiments that were run have been named to be identified easily enough
